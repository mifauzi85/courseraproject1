# Notes for reviewer

This project is to fulfill course assignment from coursera : Tools for Data Science modul 4 assignment.

For whom who will review my assignment, kindly do the following in order to make sure the code is working
1. Download the data set "data.csv" to your local machine
2. Upload the file to your notebook
3. Run the script to see the result

Otherwise the code won't work because it needs to load the data into pandas data frame.

Thank you,
Ihsan
